After months of tinkering and coding magic, I’m excited to announce the launch of a completely new version of this website!
Just a couple of weeks ago, I made it live, and it feels great to see it come together.

Visually, the design keeps the same vibe, but I think it has been refined for a more polished, modern look.
Completing the migration was a significant challenge, but it turned out to be an invaluable learning experience.
There’s always room for improvement, and I see my website as the perfect playground to put into action all the cool things I’ve been learning, both on the job and in my free time.

### The Journey

My journey with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) began three years ago when a friend invited me to join a side project.
At that time, I still had no prior experience with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)--but wait, life's about challenges, right?
So, despite of my lack of experience _(and a tiny bit of panic)_, I thought "Why not"? It was the perfect chance to level up my skills and an exciting opportunity to learn something new.
Armed with nothing but my _"learning by doing"_ mindset and a cup of **strong coffee** ☕, I decided to take on the challenge.

At first, I felt pretty overwhelmed because I had to learn a ton of new things in such a short time.
Even though I had experience with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) came with all these new concepts that were quite different, especially with its rich ecosystem and server-side rendering approach.
There were so many things I hadn’t encountered in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), so I had to adapt quickly.
But, as time went on, these challenges actually became my motivation to keep pushing myself and learning more.

With my [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) background, I dove into the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) documentation, hunted for relevant tutorials, and tackled tasks related to the project.
My experience with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) helped me understand some similar JavaScript concepts, but I still had to adjust to the different structure and features that [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) offered.
Slowly but surely, I began to feel more confident, and what once felt daunting turned into an exciting journey of growth.

### Exploring the Tech Stack

In this blog post, I’ll take you through the new tech stack and highlight some of the details!
If you’re interested in exploring the technologies I’ve utilize, this post should provide you with useful information!

<CoreStack />

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): As the foundation of my website, Its offers a perfect balance of server-side rendering, static site generation, and a robust developer experience. Another key reason I chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is that my other main project also uses it. By sticking to the same framework, I reduce context-switching friction, which helps me stay productive and consistent across projects.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): I rely on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for its type safety, which helps me catch potential bugs early and prevents runtime errors. It also provides a better developer experience, as it helps me write cleaner and more maintainable code.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): For styling, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is my go-to. Its utility-first approach allows me to create responsive, aesthetically pleasing layouts quickly while maintaining design consistency. It eliminates the hassle of naming classes and writing custom CSS from scratch.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): I chose [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for its reusable, accessible, and customizable components, which speed up development without sacrificing design flexibility.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion): Adding smooth animations and transitions is effortless with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion). It gives my website a polished, interactive feel while maintaining performance.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com): One of the standout tools in my stack is [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of JSX, allowing me to embed React components directly into my content. Why [MDX](https://mdxjs.com)? Traditional Markdown is great, but it felt limiting when I wanted to include custom elements or interactive components. With MDX, I can create dynamic, reusable components and integrate them seamlessly into my blog posts. It's an absolute game-changer, and it’s significantly more powerful than traditional Markdown or even rich-text solutions managed through a CMS.
